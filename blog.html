            <h3>100 Days of Coding Day 2</h3>
            <p>I have recently embarked on a 100 days of coding course on Python through Udemy.  Day 1 introduced printing to the console using print(), asking for end user response using input(), storing information to variables, and debugging.  </p>
            <p>On Day 2, I learned about the variable types string, integer, float, and Boolean and how to convert from one type to another.  There is also something called an f-String which allows you to combine data types in an output so you don’t have to convert everything to a string.  You do this by print(f”string {varOfSomeDataType} more string”).</p>
